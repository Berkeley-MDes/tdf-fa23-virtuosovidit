# Hello DES INV 202 Student!
Welcome to your new GitHub repository! 

If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link! 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions). They might look something like this: ###

# [Weekly Report - Week of 08/31/2023](weeklyReport20230831.md) #
This week I used the TDF Computational Design project files to get started with Rhino and Grasshopper. As someone with no experience using computational 3D modelling software this was a good starting point to explore the space and start using Laser Cutter and 3D printing tools in the Maker space.

My Process: I started with the Grasshopper and Rhino Files, learning how to use the tools using the worked example. I then spent some time defining my project scope, i.e. defining what I wanted to achieve with the stand and how it‚Äôd be useful to someone using it. I fed my design calculations into the Grasshopper interface, and generated the files to cut. I then evaluated my first laser cut and made a note of changes that‚Äôd make the design better. I gave a second cut and after I was satisfied with the results, I moved on to the 3D model. For the 3D model I took the same design considerations to generate a 3D model that‚Äôd help me, then I 3D Printed the files.

Following the completion of the process, I made a note of where I wanted to take the process in the future and designed a quick mock up of an aspirational cell phone stand that I hope to laser cut this week.

Complete Report is available here: [Weekly Report 1](weeklyReport20230831.md)

# Example Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #
This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

or, if you prefer, you can create separate files and link to them here, like so:

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- Don't worry, I already copied them over to another file for you [here.](welcomeREADME.md) So feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

sparkles,

your TDF TA, shm :sparkles:

PS: let me know if you have any questions!!
