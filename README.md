# [Weekly Report - Week of 08/31/2023](weeklyReport20230831.md) #
This week I used the TDF Computational Design project files to get started with Rhino and Grasshopper. As someone with no experience using computational 3D modelling software this was a good starting point to explore the space and start using Laser Cutter and 3D printing tools in the Maker space.

My Process: I started with the Grasshopper and Rhino Files, learning how to use the tools using the worked example. I then spent some time defining my project scope, i.e. defining what I wanted to achieve with the stand and how it’d be useful to someone using it. I fed my design calculations into the Grasshopper interface, and generated the files to cut. I then evaluated my first laser cut and made a note of changes that’d make the design better. I gave a second cut and after I was satisfied with the results, I moved on to the 3D model. For the 3D model I took the same design considerations to generate a 3D model that’d help me, then I 3D Printed the files.

Following the completion of the process, I made a note of where I wanted to take the process in the future and designed a quick mock up of an aspirational cell phone stand that I hope to laser cut this week.

# Example Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #
This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- Don't worry, I already copied them over to another file for you [here.](welcomeREADME.md) So feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

sparkles,

your TDF TA, shm :sparkles:

PS: let me know if you have any questions!!
