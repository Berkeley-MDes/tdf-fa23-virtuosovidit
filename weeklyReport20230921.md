This week I setup the Photon 2 Microcontroller to connect to a WiFi and get its MAC address. I followed Dr. Sudhu’s tutorial to get started. 


First I setup a Particle account

Then after connecting my Photon2 to the laptop, I configured the device on Particle’s website


I then ran the program to get the MAC address for my device

I copied the MAC address and then used the UC Berkeley WiFi Portal to setup my IoT network device.

I am now looking forward to use the Photon2 for my next project.
