## Summary
This week I picked the topics of interest for Project 2, for Technology Design Foundations. 

## The selection process:
I first browsed through all the suggested ideas by my cohort and bookmarked the ones I liked. My selection criteria was based on three things:

1. My Interests
2. Areas where I could contribute and learn in the Projects.
3. My own understanding of the idea and whether I felt passionate about it.

### Based on this process I finalised 6 possible topics and then zeroed in on 3 that I wanted to pick.

The three I picked were:
1. Exploring Mental Health Needs of Graduate Students: Building Physical Sensors for Anxiety Tracking and Study Habits Analysis 
2. Breaking Language Barriers: Exploring an Augmented Reality Headphone System for Fearless Tourist Experiences  My notes on the idea:  I was wondering what if to break the language barrier we don’t need AR glasses at all, what if it’s something more inconspicuous that can listen to a conversation, understand if it’s happening in a language that the user doesn’t understand and nudge them to translate instead. Something more in the realm of ubiquitous computing than AR. 
3. Enhancing Interpersonal Connections: Exploring Subtle Communication Tools for Friendships and Relationships

Future goals: 
I look forward to working on this project with the team I get.
