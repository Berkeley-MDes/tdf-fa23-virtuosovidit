## Vidit Bhargava

**Summary**
This week the team worked on the ideation for the the Project 2. 

**The process:**
After multiple team meetings we etched out the solutions for our design brief, we then moved on to work on the ideas for our solutions.

After the ideas were etched we sat down to pick the APIs that we could use to accomplish our goals.

Following that we worked on the components we would need to accomplish our goals.

**The result:**
We had a sketch of our ideas and a spec sheet for what we want to build.
